### Abstract
Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. Previous studies found intratumoral heterogeneity in RB. However, how the malignant progression in RB is determined by the heterogeneity of tumor cells and tumor microenvironment remains uncharacterized. Here, we conducted transcriptomic profiles of around 70,000 cells from seven human RB samples with pathological and clinical measurements. We identified that the major cell types in RB were cone precursor-like (CP-like) and MKI67+ cone precursor (MKI67+ CP) cells. By integrating copy number variation (CNV) analysis, we found that RB samples had large clonal heterogeneity, where the malignant MKI67+ CP cells had significantly larger copy number changes. Enrichment analysis revealed that the conversion of CP-like to MKI67+ CP resulted in the loss of photoreceptor function and increased cell proliferation ability. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in RB was composed of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), astrocyte-like and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Particularly, during the invasion process, TAMs created an immunosuppressive environment, in which the proportion of TAMs decreased, M1-type macrophage was lost, and the TAMs-related immune functions were depressed. Finally, we identified that TAMs regulated tumor cells through GRN and MIF signaling pathways, while TAMs self-regulated through inhibition of CCL and GALECTIN signaling pathways during the invasion process. Altogether, our study creates a detailed transcriptomic map of RB with single-cell characterization of malignant phenotypes and provides novel molecular insights into the occurrence and progression of RB.
